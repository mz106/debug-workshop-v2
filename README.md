# debug-workshop-v2

## Aim

The purpose is to teach and give practice in problem-solving methods 
and to familarise students with the error stack and debugging techniques, 
and instill a sense of teamwork.

## Particulars

- This workshop is aimed at students who have completed the first week of
the Masters course

- The workshop is expected to last for circa one hour, with a 10 -15 minute 
retro. 

## Specification Compliance

## Note

This is a work-in-progress and is a single workshop of a planned series. Once
more data/feedback had been acquired, and with more complex problems designed 
later stages of the Masters course, more of the specification requirements can
be reached. 

3.1.1 Problem Solving - 'Break down a problem into smaller problems' - being 
given a problem with three stages of solution, with each stage requiring 
analysis, the problem teaches students the importance and necessity of 
breaking a problem into smaller problems. 

3.1.2 Problem Solving - 'Re-write or explain problems in their own words' -
asking students questions (Knowledge, Comprehension) e.g. 'what is the 
difference between an error and a bug?', and allowing for understanding of 
the problem in their own words. 

3.1.3/3.1.4 Problem Solving - 'Find the key explicit keywords of problems/Pull 
out implicit keywords of problems (what should I be thinking about?)' -
When analysing the error stack, students will be exposed to direct analysis,
teaching them to hone-in on the keywords of the given error. 

3.1.8/3.1.9 Problem Solving - 'Create and follow a plan when solving problems/
Refactor a plan when it doesnâ€™t lead to a solution' - encourage students to 
discuss the problem and develop a plan e.g. console.log to find the cause of errors,
and then to change if no solution is reached. 

3.2.1 Technical Communication - 'Accurately explain the project they are 
working on from a technical perspective' - by introducing introducing 
technical language used in error tracing/debugging e.g. the difference between 
a bug and an error, and renforcing technical language learnt up to workshop
delivery. 

3.2.2 Technical Communication - 'Consistently use the correct terminology in 
conversation' - by teaching new language displaying the need for exactness
and clarity in order to accomplish a goal.  

## Method

After a brief introduction from the instructor, students will follow an 
instructor-led debugging session, in which they shall be asked knowledge/
comprehension questions, with technical language given. From here, they 
shall attempt to guide the instructor towards a solution. The instructor 
shall offer guidance with direct questions, but NOT provide a solution, unless
students become unable. 

A retro on the quality of the workshop/instruction will then follow. 

## Bugs

- bug 1 line two has const employee should be const employees 
- bug 2 checkedEmployees not returned checkName
- bug 3 variable i used twice in for loops - change 2nd loop to j checkName
