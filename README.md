# debug-workshop-v2

## Aim

The purpose is to teach and give practice in problem-solving methods 
and to familarise students with the error stack and debugging techniques, 
and instill a sense of teamwork.

## Specification Compliance

3.1.1 Problem Solving - 'Break down a problem into smaller problems' - being 
given a problem with three stages of solution, with each stage requiring 
analysis, the problem teaches students the importance and necessity of 
breaking a problem into smaller problems. 

3.1.2 Problem Solving - 'Re-write or explain problems in their own words' -
asking students questions (Knowledge, Comprehension) e.g. 'what is the 
difference between an error and a bug?', and allowing for understanding of 
the problem in their own words. 

3.1.3/3.1.4 Problem Solving - 'Find the key explicit keywords of problems/Pull 
out implicit keywords of problems (what should I be thinking about?)' -
When analysing the error stack, students will be exposed to direct analysis,
teaching them to hone-in on the keywords of the given error. 

3.2.1 Technical Communication - 'Accurately explain the project they are 
working on from a technical perspective' - by introducing introducing 
technical language used in error tracing/debugging e.g. the difference between 
a bug and an error, and renforcing technical language learnt up to workshop
delivery. 

3.2.2 Technical Communication - 'Consistently use the correct terminology in 
conversation' - by teaching new language displaying the need for exactness
and clarity in order to accomplish a goal.  

This workshop will aid in students development in technical communication, 
teaching about the language of errors, bugs and debugging. Also, it will
deliver methods for problems, including;

- Breaking down problems
- Understanding the context of a problem
- Planning solutions and refactoring

## Method

After a brief introduction from the instructor, students will be placed into 
teams in which they shall run the program and read the errorstack. 
From here, they shall atempt to resolve the first bugs. An instructor(s) will 
be on hand to offer guidance, but NOT to resolve theissue for the students. 

Once the teams have a fully working program, a retro will be help, 
concerning both the techniques that they have used, and the quality
of the workshop itself.

## Bugs

bug 1 line two has const employee should be const employees 
bug 2 checkedEmployees not returned checkName
bug 3 variable i used twice in for loops - change 2nd loop to j checkName
